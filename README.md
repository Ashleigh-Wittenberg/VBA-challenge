# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge

With this challenge I created script to perform the following tasks:

  Looked through all 3 sheets in the workbook to identify and display the unique Ticker symbols for each year and populated the results in the I column with the Ticker header.
  
  Calculated the yearly change from the opening price to the closing price for each unique ticker. I populated those results in column J with the Yearly Change header.
  
  Calculated the percentage of change from the yearly open and close price. Populating the results into column K with the Percent Change header.
  
  Calculated the total stock volume for each unique ticked and placed the results in column L with the column header Total Stock Volume.
  
  Calculated the greatest % increase and decrease as well as the greatest total volume for all 3 years. Then populated those results in column Q in the row corresponding with each title. 
  
  Lasty, I added the conditional formatting to column J Yearly Change to indicate positive changes in green and negative changes in red. Then add formatting to column K and cells Q2 and Q3 to show as a % with 2 decimal places.

Please see below for the screen shots of the result.
